    <h3 class="aboutus_title text-center">DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCES</h3>
    <p>The Department of Veterinary and Animal Science is established with five acres of land in ACAR, Athimugam, during
        the year of 2016. The main objective is to impart fundamentals education in Livestock and Poultry Production to
        the undergraduate students. It comprises of various units Viz, Cattle, Buffalo, Sheep, Goat, Pig, Poultry
        (Broiler & Native Chicken), Azolla, Fodder cultivation, Integrated Farming System, Hatchery Unit and two animal
        husbandry labs for education and research purpose. The department of Veterinary and Animal Science is attending
        to the needs of the farmers by transferring the technologies, demonstrations, training, exhibitions and
        consultations.</p>
    <h5 class="text-secondary">Vision</h5>
    <p> To educate the local farmers on production and management of livestock and poultry by establishing modern
        hatchery Unit, feed mill and IFS.</p>
    <h5 class="text-secondary">Mission</h5>
    <p> Through the popularization of the Kadaknath and native chicken in district besides advocating the modern IFS
        facilitating the farmers for better supply chain to achieve higher income.</p>
    <h5 class="text-secondary">Objectives</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the basic education about livestock and poultry production to the students and farmers.</li>
        <li>To serve as a unique model mixed farming and integrated farming
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="aboutus_title">VARIOUS UNITS</h3>
    <h5 class="text-secondary"> Cattle & Buffalo Unit</h5>
    <p>This department is maintaining the cattle and buffalo units to fulfil the demands of milk and milk products to
        the ACAR hostel and local sale.</p>

    <h5 class="text-secondary">Sheep and Goat Unit</h5>
    <p> Sheep and goat are reared under free ranging system to provide the basic practical demonstration, trainings to
        the undergraduate students, farmers and entrepreneurs. The droppings of sheep and goats contain higher nutrients
        than farmyard manure and compost. On an average, the manure contains three per cent N, one per cent P2O5 and two
        per cent K2O. Manure realised is used for our agricultural fields. In addition, the meat and live animals are
        being utilized.</p>

    <h5 class="text-secondary">Pig unit</h5>
    <p>Pigs are monogastric animals and most potential source of meat and more efficient feed converters after the
        broiler.
        Pig farming will provide employment opportunities to seasonally employed rural farmers and support supplementary
        income to improve their living standards. Pigs manure is widely used as fertilizer for agriculture farms and
        fish
        ponds. In ACAR maintenance of pig farm with the feeding of food waste from kitchen to minimise the cost of
        production</p>

    <h5 class="text-secondary">Poultry Unit</h5>

    <p>Poultry farming is a continuous source of income. It is not seasonal and can produce income for the entire year.
        Chickens lay eggs between 6 to 8 months, broilers take 6 to 10 weeks to bring in income. Meat, eggs, feathers
        and
        manure of chicken and broilers are all saleable and income generating. Poultry farming in a small scale requires
        only minimum space and they can be reared even in the backyards of homes. The excreta of birds ferment very
        quickly.
        Poultry manure contains higher nitrogen and phosphorus compared to other bulky organic manures. The average
        nutrient
        content is 3.03 per cent N; 2.63 per cent P2O5 and 1.4 per cent K2O.Poultry feathers are also used for making
        pillows, fancy articles and curios. ACAR broiler units maintains 3000 chickâ€™s capacity to produce clean,
        hygienic,
        antibiotic free chicken and eggs to supply to the Adhiyamaan Engineering College hostels, ACAR and local sale.
    </p>

    <h5 class="text-secondary"> Fodder Cultivation & Azolla </h5>

    <p>Three acres of land for fodders and 10 cents of land for Azolla cultivated for feeding the livestock and poultry and
    also to conduct the trainings and demonstration to the students and farmers. ACAR farm cultivates fodders like Super
    Napier, Co5, Hedge Lucerne and CoFS 29.</p>

    <h5 class="text-secondary">Integrated Farming System</h5>

    <p>The IFS model combines various compatible enterprises such as crops (field crops, horticultural crops), agroforestry
    (agri-silvi culture, agri-horticulture, agri-pastoral, silvi-pastoral, horti- pastoral), livestock (dairy, pigs,
    poultry, small ruminants), fishery, mushroom and bee culture in a synergistic way so that the wastes of one process
    become the input for other processes for optimum farm productivity.</p>

    <h5 class="text-secondary">Incubation and Hatchery Unit</h5>

    <p>The department of Veterinary and Animal Science is maintaining 100 eggs capacity an incubation and hatchery unit to
    produce good quality native chicks and to support the practical classes to the students and farmers.</p>
