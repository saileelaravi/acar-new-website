            Agricultural growth is an important step towards national economic development and 
            transformation. However, the new challenges facing Indian agriculture in todayâ€™s more 
            globalized environment have led some questions whether conventional wisdom about 
            the role of agriculture in development is still applicable. 
            Since agriculture constitutes a large share of national output and 
            employs a majority of the labour force, the sector has been integral part 
            national development.

            The reason for selecting Athimugam for establishing the Agricultural College was, 
            Krishnagiri District is basically a backward District both Educationally & Economically
            and a drought prone area due to failure of seasonal rain. 
            This area is famous for cash crops such as Mango, Tamarind & Horticulture crops 
            and is exporting cut flowers to various parts of the world because of its proximity to
             Bangalore Airport. Because of the above facts, the Trust has concluded that this a 
             suitable place to start an Agricultural College so that the College can play a 
             vital role in improving the standard of living of farmers of this area.
